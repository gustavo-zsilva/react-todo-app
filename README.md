This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ⚛️ React To-do App ⚛️

This app is a simple to-do application that lets you keep track of your tasks.

## What can it do?

- Adding new tasks to the list
- Clear the tasks you select (not added yet)
- Clear all tasks (not added yet)
- Clear all finished tasks
- See how many tasks are left to do

### Also, it

- Saves tasks in localStorage with and unique ID (from the UUID library)
- Saves checked tasks

## What technologies does it use?

- Vanilla Javascript
- ReactJS (for developing the visual/logical part of the app)
- UUID (for generating the unique ID's)

## What did I learn?

For this project, I can say that I improved my React skills,
also, I looked by a different angle on how to build front-end
applications, not with an HTML, Javascript and CSS file only,
but working with components, which is a Javascript function that returns
HTML basically, and is also reusable code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
